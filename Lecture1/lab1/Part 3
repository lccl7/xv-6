Q1:Explain the interface between printf.c and console.c. Specifically,
what function does console.c export? How is this function used by printf.c?
A1:printf.c use the function cputchar() in console.c. 

Q2:Explain the following in console.c:
1   if (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {
2           int i;
3           memmove(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
4           for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i < CRT_SIZE; i++)
5                   crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
6           crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
7   }
A2: crt_pos is the position that will be displayed and CRT_SIZE is the window displayed.
So if crt_pos is bigger than CRT_SIZE, then we should move(memmove) one row up so that
the last row will be left for what will be displayed. The for loop is used for displaying 
space(' '). Then the position is located the right place.
